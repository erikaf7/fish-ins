            <h3>Overview of the Past</h3>
            
            <p>In 1964, Survival of the American Indian Society (SAIA) with the help of other organizations like the NAACP and the National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) worked together to protest for the fishing rights of American Indians. To do this they staged "fish-ins" where American Indians would simply fish and get arrested for it. A Nisqually tribal leader, Billy Frank Jr., was pivotal in organizing the protests and got arrested over 50 times himself. This got attention from the media and led to involvment from celebrities like Marlon Brando who got arrested participating. The fish-in protests were successful, and led to the Boldt decision in 1974, effectively giving American Indians their fishing rights back. This gives them the right to take up to 50 percent of harvestable fish and gives them an equal part in managing the fishing industry. </p>
            
            <h3>1970 Fish Wars protests come to a violent crescendo</h3>
        
            <p>Tensions between PNW Indians and game wardens came to a head on September 9, 1970 when a confrontation broke out between members of the Puyallup tribe and Tacoma police officers. State officials and police attested that the tribes people were fishing illegally, whereas the indigenous protesters stated they had every right to fish in these waters – a right guaranteed by the Medicine Creek Treaty of 1854. Shots were fired, a fire bomb was thrown, and when the dust settled approximately 60 American Indian protestors were arrested.</p>

            <h3>Post 1970 congressional intervention and federal litigation</h3>
            <p>As the violent game warden and state official response to American Indians fishing in their ancestral waters continued to attract widespread attention by the media, there was an increasing call from the American public for congress to step in and do something about the issue. In 1974 the federal government sued the state of Washington in a monumental case, United States v. Washington in which judge George Hugo Boldt ruled that the state of Washington had infringed upon treaty granted rights of American Indians to fish in their ancestral waters. The Boldt decision, as it was later nicknamed, stipulated that the tribes of the Pacific Northwest were entitled to 50% of the fish harvested in the state of Washington each year.</p>

                <p>
                    The decision was a landmark victory for the tribes, but did little to ease tensions that had been growing between state officials, commercial fisheries, and the indigenous people. Protests ensued for years after the Boldt decision including demonstrations calling for Boldt to be killed, removed from duty, and which were racially and politically motivated.

            <h3>Post Boldt Decision</h3>
            <p>Since 1974, the Boldt Decision has been challenged by appeals but at each juncture, Boldt’s ruling has been upheld by the court. Not only were the events of the fish wars instrumental in influencing the outcome of the Boldt Decision, this brave indigenous resistance was a catalyst for further resistance which continues to the present day. Most recently, the Fish Wars Bridge – or as it has been renamed “Yabuk’ʷali” meaning “place of a fight”, was the gathering space for a protest of Tacoma’s proposed LNG plant. Indigenous resistance continues to fight for the restoration of land, the recognition and celebration of a people, as well as the responsible stewardship of natural resources.

            <h3>In the Present</h3>
            <p>Currently, American Indians retain the right to fish, but there are challanges facing those rights. Salmon populations are declining due to climate change and man-made factors such as hydro-electric dams. Actions are being taken by tribes such as choosing not to fish until the populations recover. In honor of one protester, The Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge was renamed to The Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in honor of the late Nisqually Tribal leader Billy Frank Jr.</p>
